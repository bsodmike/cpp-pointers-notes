# cpp-pointers-notes

Example on "desugaring" how double-pointers can be used as a form of indirection in C++ code. The `char **` notation can be rather cryptic to read off the bat, hence this example shows how to construct it using the shorthand way or a more verbose way, that breaks it into each step.
